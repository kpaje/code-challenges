//DATA STRUCTURES
// Ways of organinzing information with optimal 'runtime complexity' for adding or removing records

//QUEUE
// Linear processing like standing in line for a ticket
// No skipping or cutting in line
// Enqueuing = adding
// Dequeuing = removing
// FIFO = First In First Out

//STACKS
// Ordered list of records like a queue
// Push = adding
// Pop = removing
// FILO = First In First Out; last record in is last record out
