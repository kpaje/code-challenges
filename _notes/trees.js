//TREES!
// A node holds data and a reference to any of it's children
// children = sub nodes
// siblings = same level but doesn't necessarily have the same parent
// traversal = iterating through a tree

//BREADTH-FIRST TRAVERSAL
// Starting from the root node, iterate through each level of a tree from left to right

//DEPTH-FIRST TRAVERSAL
// starting from the root node, iterate through  the very left side down to the bottom of a parent-child relationship
// trying to reach the end of a tree as fast as possible
